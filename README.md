The E-Learning platform was designed and developed to provide a structured, user-friendly interface for online learners. I used HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing multi-page layout with dedicated sections for Home, Courses, About, Contact, and Certified Courses. JavaScript was used to enhance interactivity and manage navigation between sections. I also embedded YouTube videos for free course content and added hover effects, smooth scrolling, and responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices. This project enabled me to practice real-world UI structuring, content organization, and front-end integration of multimedia resources.
